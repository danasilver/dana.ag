Over my winter break of 2013 I created an API for [menus.middlebury.edu](http://menus.middlebury.edu), the official menu website for my school, Middlebury College. A quick visit to the site shows that it is powered by Drupal.  This is a recent change, which besides rendering a disorienting menu (dinner often appears before breakfast), removed the API functionality the site once provided.
